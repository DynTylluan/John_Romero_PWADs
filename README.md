# John Romero PWADs

This is a copy of [an article]([https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php?title=John_Romero_PWADs&oldid=3118](https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php?title=John_Romero_PWADs&oldid=3153)) that I wrote for the [Chocolate Doom](https://www.chocolate-doom.org) on how you can deal with PWADs made by John Romero.

In this git, I made two versions: [the original wikitext version of the article](wikitext.txt) and [a markdown version of the text](markdown.md). There is also [`SIGILDOS.png`](SIGILDOS.png), something not made by me and is a [screenshot showing the title screen for the port of SIGIL: Vanilla Edition, running version 3.0.0 of Chocolate Doom on EndeavourOS](https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php?title=File:SIGILDOS.png&oldid=3117).

There isn't all that much to add to this file and I only wanted to upload this as a way to make it easier to search my own works.
